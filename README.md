=============
My first c++ project.

file explanations:
* main.cpp - main file, run this to create binary
* create.h - header with code for setting up the character
* inv.h - header with code for the inventory system
* level1.h - header with code containing the first level
* menus.h - header with code for the menu system.
* money.h - header containing the monetary system

need to:
* remove system calls
* impliment the inventory system <----(mostly done)
* add items in game randomly <----(function complete, needs implementation in game)
* add a health system
* add a fighting system
* add a map
* add an in game menu <----(in game inventory menu created, needs more work)
* make different difficulties <----(difficulties are chooseable, they just don't do anything)
